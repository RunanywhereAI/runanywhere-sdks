## Critical Gaps by Priority

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)
These must be addressed first as other components depend on them.

#### 1.1 SDK Initialization & Bootstrap
**Gaps:**
- Missing 8-step bootstrap process (KMP has 4 steps)
- No device info collection
- No analytics initialization
- Limited event publishing during init

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add DeviceInfo collection in PlatformContext
- [ ] Implement 8-step bootstrap matching iOS
- [ ] Add comprehensive initialization events
- [ ] Implement analytics service initialization

#### 1.2 Network Layer
**Gaps:**
- Production APIClient not implemented (uses MockNetworkService for all environments)
- No retry logic with exponential backoff
- Missing platform-specific HttpClient implementations

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Complete APIClient implementation for production
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement expect/actual HttpClient for each platform
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors

#### 1.3 Data Storage Layer (In-Memory Cache)
**Note:** Using enhanced in-memory cache for now, actual database implementation deferred.

**Current Approach:**
- Enhanced in-memory cache with persistence simulation
- Thread-safe concurrent collections
- Flow-based real-time data observation
- Mock persistence for development/testing

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Enhance in-memory cache with better data structures
- [ ] Add Flow-based observation for cache changes
- [ ] Implement cache eviction policies
- [ ] Add data serialization for state restoration
- [ ] TODO: Future - Implement SQLDelight for actual persistence

### Priority 2: Data Management

#### 2.1 Repository Pattern
**Gaps:**
- No data source abstraction layer
- Missing centralized SyncCoordinator
- Basic error handling without structured hierarchy
- Thread safety concerns with manual mutex

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create DataSource interface hierarchy
- [ ] Implement SyncCoordinator with batch processing
- [ ] Add structured error handling
- [ ] Use coroutine-safe concurrency patterns

#### 2.2 Model Management
**Gaps:**
- SimpleDownloadService is placeholder only
- No resume capability
- No concurrent download management
- Missing storage monitoring

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement production DownloadService
- [ ] Add resume capability with persistent state
- [ ] Support concurrent downloads with queue
- [ ] Add storage monitoring and cleanup

### Priority 3: Component Features

#### 3.1 STT Pipeline
**Gaps:**
- Language detection not exposed at iOS component level
- Event models differ between platforms
- Configuration options inconsistent

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add language detection API to iOS STTComponent
- [ ] Align streaming event models
- [ ] Standardize configuration options
- [ ] Unify error handling patterns

#### 3.2 Authentication Service
**Gaps:**
- Token refresh not implemented
- KMP lacks platform-specific SecureStorage
- No biometric authentication support

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic
- [ ] Add platform-specific SecureStorage implementations
- [ ] Add biometric authentication support
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning

#### 3.3 Event Bus
**Gaps:**
- KMP missing Performance, Network, Storage event categories
- No convenience methods for filtering
- Missing event correlation

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add missing event categories
- [ ] Implement convenience filtering methods
- [ ] Add event correlation with request IDs
- [ ] Add event persistence for debugging

### Priority 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1 LLM Integration
**Gaps:**
- KMP implementation is mostly placeholder/mock
- Missing actual LlamaCpp integration
- No model management for LLMs

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Complete LlamaCpp JNI integration
- [ ] Implement model loading and inference
- [ ] Add streaming generation
- [ ] Implement context management

#### 4.2 Configuration Management
**Gaps:**
- iOS lacks granular feature flags
- No schema validation
- Different development mode approaches

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Port KMP's feature flag system to iOS
- [ ] Add configuration schema validation
- [ ] Align development mode handling
- [ ] Add configuration versioning

#### 4.3 TTS Pipeline
**Note:** Both implementations work well with different approaches. Minor alignment only.

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add raw audio extraction to iOS if possible
- [ ] Port SSML processing to iOS
- [ ] Align voice selection APIs

### Priority 5: Polish & Optimization

#### 5.1 Module Registry
**Well-aligned, minor enhancements:**
- [ ] Add priority-based selection
- [ ] Implement capability metadata
- [ ] Add performance-based provider selection

#### 5.2 VAD System
**Recently aligned, minimal work:**
- [ ] Verify parameter consistency
- [ ] Add advanced VAD model support
- [ ] Optimize platform-specific implementations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. SDK Initialization & Bootstrap
2. Network Layer completion
3. Database cross-platform setup

### Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 3-4)
1. Repository pattern with DataSource
2. Model downloading service
3. Authentication enhancements

### Phase 3: Components (Weeks 5-6)
1. STT pipeline alignment
2. Event bus enhancements
3. Configuration management

### Phase 4: Advanced (Weeks 7-8)
1. LLM integration completion
2. TTS alignment
3. Module registry enhancements

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Week 9)
1. Cross-platform testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation updates

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Common Main
- Keep all business logic in commonMain
- Use interfaces and abstract classes for platform abstractions
- Leverage sealed classes for type safety
- Use Flow for reactive patterns

### Platform Implementations
- **JVM**: Focus on desktop/server compatibility
- **Android**: Leverage Room, WorkManager, Android-specific APIs
- **iOS/Native**: Use platform-specific optimizations where beneficial

### Provider Pattern
- Use ModuleRegistry for all pluggable components
- Maintain consistent provider interfaces
- Support runtime registration

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 13 components achieve feature parity
- [ ] Cross-platform tests pass on all targets
- [ ] IntelliJ plugin demo works with all features
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation complete for all components

## Next Steps
1. Review this implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Update progress in todos as we complete each item
4. Test continuously on all platforms
