# Android Sample App Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing basic STT demo into a comprehensive Android sample app that mirrors the iOS RunAnywhereAI experience, following the detailed implementation plan from `ANDROID_SAMPLE_APP_IMPL_PLAN.md`.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Basic MainActivity with STT functionality
- ✅ SDK integration setup
- ✅ Hilt, Compose, Navigation dependencies configured
- ✅ Basic permissions handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup
1. **Create Application Class**: Proper SDK initialization with framework adapters
2. **Transform MainActivity**: Single activity with navigation container
3. **Set up Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation with 5 screens
4. **Create Base Structure**: ViewModels, repositories, and domain models

### Phase 2: Core Screens Implementation
1. **Chat Screen**: Message interface with streaming responses
2. **Voice Assistant Screen**: Full conversational pipeline
3. **Transcription Screen**: STT-only mode with speaker diarization
4. **Storage Screen**: Model management interface
5. **Settings Screen**: Configuration and API key management

### Phase 3: Core Services
1. **Audio Capture Service**: Enhanced audio recording with proper lifecycle
2. **Voice Pipeline Service**: Modular pipeline for different modes
3. **Analytics Service**: Performance and usage tracking
4. **Model Manager Service**: Dynamic model loading and management

## Key Design Decisions
- **MVVM + Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Single Activity**: Navigation Compose for all screens
- **Event-Driven Pipeline**: Reactive programming with Flow/StateFlow
- **Modular Voice Pipeline**: Support for different configurations (STT-only, full assistant)
- **SDK Integration**: Use existing SDK, add TODOs for missing features

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Application setup, Navigation, Basic screens
2. **Medium Priority**: Voice pipeline, Chat interface
3. **Lower Priority**: Advanced features, animations, polish

## Next Steps
1. Create Application class with proper SDK initialization
2. Update MainActivity to use navigation
3. Implement navigation structure with bottom tabs
4. Create basic screen implementations
5. Add voice pipeline services
