# This directory will contain:
#   - RABackendONNX.xcframework (STT/TTS/VAD backend)
#   - onnxruntime.xcframework (ONNX Runtime 1.17.1)
#
# Downloaded automatically during pod install (when testLocal=false)
# Or copied manually for local development (when testLocal=true)
#
# NOTE: onnxruntime is bundled directly (like Swift/React Native SDKs)
# rather than using CocoaPods 'onnxruntime-c' dependency for version consistency.
