   - Blocks: Android app voice input
   - Timeline: 5-7 days

3. **Speaker Diarization Emergency** (Module 4)
   - Blocks: Feature parity with iOS
   - Blocks: Advanced voice features
   - Timeline: 10-12 days (large gap)

### üü° High Priority Dependencies
4. **Android App Voice Reliability** (Module 3)
   - Depends: Modules 1 & 2 completion
   - Blocks: Production voice assistant
   - Timeline: 3-4 days after dependencies

5. **Android App Feature Completion** (Module 3)
   - Independent: Settings and Storage can start immediately
   - Parallel: Can run alongside other modules
   - Timeline: 6-8 days

## Resource Allocation Validation

### Optimal Team Structure (Validated)
Based on dependency analysis, the optimal structure is:

**Team Alpha (1 Senior Developer)**: Critical Path
- Module 1: LLM Implementation (Week 1)
- Module 2: STT Implementation (Week 1-2)
- Support: Integration assistance (Week 3-4)

**Team Bravo (1 Senior Android Developer)**: App Features
- Module 3: Android App Completion (Week 2-4)
- Depends: Alpha 50% complete before starting voice features

**Team Charlie (1 Developer + 1 ML Engineer)**: Advanced Features
- Module 4: Speaker Diarization (Week 1-4)
- Mostly parallel execution, some integration dependencies

**Team Delta (Shared Resource)**: Integration
- Documentation and testing support (Week 1-5)
- Final integration coordination (Week 4-5)

### Parallel Execution Efficiency
- **Week 1**: 3 teams working in parallel (maximum efficiency)
- **Week 2**: 3 teams with Alpha unblocking Bravo
- **Week 3**: All teams integrated development
- **Week 4**: Final integration and polish
