# Module 5: Parallel Execution Roadmap
**Purpose**: Coordinated multi-team execution plan for maximum efficiency
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks for complete iOS-Android parity
**Team Structure**: 3-4 developers working in parallel streams

## Executive Summary

This roadmap enables multiple developers to work simultaneously on different modules while managing dependencies and integration points. The plan maximizes parallel execution to achieve full iOS-Android parity in the shortest time possible.

**Key Strategy**: Front-load independent modules, manage critical path, coordinate integration points.
