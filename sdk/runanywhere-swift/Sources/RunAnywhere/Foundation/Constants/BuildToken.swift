/// - Token is used ONLY when SDK is in .development mode
/// - Backend validates token via POST /api/v1/devices/register/dev
///
/// Token Properties:
/// - Format: bt_<uuid>_<timestamp>
/// - Rotatable: Each release gets a new token
/// - Revocable: Backend can mark token as inactive
/// - Rate-limited: Backend enforces 100 req/min per device
