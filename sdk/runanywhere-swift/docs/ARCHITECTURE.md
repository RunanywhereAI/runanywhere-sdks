- Hardware-specific optimizations (Metal, Neural Engine)

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Simple, intuitive API that hides complexity
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Extensive logging and debugging capabilities

### 4. **Extensibility**
- Protocol-oriented design for easy customization
- Plugin architecture for model formats and providers
- Clean separation of concerns

### 5. **Cost Efficiency**

### Public API Layer
The topmost layer that developers interact with directly. Provides a clean, Swift-idiomatic interface that hides internal complexity.

### Core Engine Layer
The brain of the SDK that handles routing decisions, execution orchestration, and cost optimization.

### Model Management Layer
Responsible for model lifecycle including downloading, validation, caching, and registry management.

### Runtime Providers Layer
Pluggable providers for different model formats, each optimized for specific use cases and hardware.

### Platform Services Layer
Low-level services that interact with the operating system and hardware capabilities.

    end note
```

### Model Lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: Models are discovered through the registry
2. **Download**: Large model files are downloaded on-demand
3. **Validation**: Models are validated for integrity and compatibility
4. **Loading**: Models are loaded into memory with appropriate provider
5. **Caching**: Loaded models are cached based on usage patterns
6. **Eviction**: Least recently used models are evicted when memory is needed

### Model Formats Support

Each model format has a dedicated provider that handles:
- Format-specific loading
- Hardware optimization
- Inference execution
- Memory management

Supported formats:
- **GGUF**: Optimized for CPU execution with quantization support
- **Core ML**: Leverages Apple's Neural Engine for maximum performance
- **MLX**: Apple's new framework for unified memory architecture
- **ONNX**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Lightweight models for edge devices

## Execution Strategy

### Decision Factors

The router considers multiple factors when choosing execution path:

1. **Device Capabilities**
   - Available memory
   - CPU/GPU performance
   - Neural Engine availability
   - Battery level

2. **Model Requirements**
   - Model size
   - Memory requirements
   - Supported hardware
   - Performance characteristics

3. **User Preferences**
   - Privacy mode settings
   - Cost thresholds
   - Latency requirements
   - Quality preferences

4. **Current Context**
   - Network availability
   - System load
   - Thermal state
   - Background app state

### Fallback Strategy

    Error --> Suggestions[Include Recovery Suggestions]

    style Success fill:#90EE90
    style Error fill:#FFB6C1
    style Router fill:#87CEEB
```

## Memory Management

### Memory Optimization Strategies

1. **Lazy Loading**: Models are loaded only when needed
2. **Partial Loading**: Load only required model layers
3. **Memory Mapping**: Use mmap for large model files
4. **Quantization**: Support for quantized models (4-bit, 8-bit)
5. **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjust memory usage based on system state

### Memory Pressure Handling

```swift
class UnifiedMemoryManager {
    func handleMemoryPressure(_ level: MemoryPressureLevel) {
        switch level {
        case .normal:
            // Normal operation
        case .warning:
            // Start evicting cached models
        case .urgent:
            // Aggressive eviction
        case .critical:
            // Emergency shutdown
        }
    }
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption at Rest**: Model files are encrypted on disk
2. **Secure Communication**: TLS 1.3 for all network requests
3. **Key Management**: Secure storage of API keys using Keychain
4. **Data Isolation**: Each app has isolated model storage

### Privacy Controls

```swift
public enum PrivacyMode {
    case strict      // No cloud execution, no telemetry
    case balanced    // Cloud allowed with user consent
    case permissive  // Full cloud integration
}
```

### Audit Trail

- All routing decisions are logged
- User consent is tracked
- Data processing locations are recorded
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

1. **Model Cache**: Loaded models kept in memory
2. **Result Cache**: Recent generation results cached
3. **Token Cache**: Tokenized inputs cached
4. **Download Cache**: Downloaded model files cached

### Hardware Acceleration

- **Metal Performance Shaders**: GPU acceleration
- **Neural Engine**: Leveraging Apple's ML accelerator
- **SIMD Instructions**: Vectorized operations
- **Unified Memory**: Efficient data sharing on Apple Silicon

### Batch Processing

```swift
public extension RunAnywhereSDK {
    func generateBatch(_ requests: [GenerationRequest]) async -> [GenerationResult] {
        // Optimized batch processing
    }
}
```

## Extension Points

### Protocol-Based Design

The SDK uses protocols extensively to allow customization:

```swift
public protocol ModelProvider {
    func loadModel(from url: URL) async throws -> LoadedModel
    func supports(format: ModelFormat) -> Bool
}

public protocol HardwareDetector {
    func detectCapabilities() -> HardwareCapabilities
}

public protocol AuthProvider {
    func getAuthToken() async throws -> String
}

public protocol CostCalculator {
    func calculate(tokens: Int, model: String) -> Decimal
}
```

### Plugin Architecture

Developers can extend the SDK by:
1. Implementing custom model providers
2. Adding new hardware detectors
3. Creating custom auth providers
4. Implementing alternative cost calculators

### Event System

```swift
public protocol RunAnywhereDelegate: AnyObject {
    func sdkDidStartLoading(model: String)
    func sdkDidFinishLoading(model: String)
    func sdkDidStartGeneration()
    func sdkDidFinishGeneration(result: GenerationResult)
    func sdkDidEncounterError(_ error: RunAnywhereError)
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Model Quantization**: On-device model optimization
2. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model updates
3. **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combining multiple models
4. **Custom Model Training**: Fine-tuning on device
5. **Cross-Device Sync**: Syncing models across user devices

### Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale:
- Support for 100+ model formats
- Handling models up to 100GB
- Concurrent execution of multiple models
- Distributed caching across devices

## Conclusion

The RunAnywhere Swift SDK architecture provides a robust foundation for intelligent AI model execution. Its modular design, comprehensive feature set, and focus on privacy and performance make it suitable for a wide range of applications while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
