## Critical Gaps by Priority

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)
These must be addressed first as other components depend on them.

#### 1.1 SDK Initialization & Bootstrap
**Gaps:**
- Missing 8-step bootstrap process (KMP has 4 steps)
- No device info collection
- No analytics initialization
- Limited event publishing during init

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add DeviceInfo collection in PlatformContext
- [ ] Implement 8-step bootstrap matching iOS
- [ ] Add comprehensive initialization events
- [ ] Implement analytics service initialization

#### 1.2 Network Layer
**Gaps:**

- No retry logic with exponential backoff
- Missing platform-specific HttpClient implementations

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Complete APIClient implementation for production
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement expect/actual HttpClient for each platform
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors

#### 1.3 Data Storage Layer (In-Memory Cache)
**Note:** Using enhanced in-memory cache for now, actual database implementation deferred.

**Current Approach:**
- Enhanced in-memory cache with persistence simulation
- Thread-safe concurrent collections
- Flow-based real-time data observation
- Mock persistence for development/testing

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Enhance in-memory cache with better data structures
- [ ] Add Flow-based observation for cache changes
- [ ] Implement cache eviction policies
- [ ] Add data serialization for state restoration
- [ ] TODO: Future - Implement SQLDelight for actual persistence

### Priority 2: Data Management

#### 2.1 Repository Pattern
**Gaps:**
- No data source abstraction layer
- Missing centralized SyncCoordinator
- Basic error handling without structured hierarchy
- Thread safety concerns with manual mutex

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create DataSource interface hierarchy
- [ ] Implement SyncCoordinator with batch processing
- [ ] Add structured error handling
- [ ] Use coroutine-safe concurrency patterns

#### 2.2 Model Management âœ… COMPLETED
**Previous Gaps (Now Fixed):**

- [x] âœ… Implemented MockNetworkService properly following NetworkService interface
- [x] âœ… All compilation errors resolved, JVM build successful

**Key Files Implemented:**

- `MockNetworkService.kt` - Proper interface implementation
- Fixed platform-specific NetworkChecker for JVM

### Priority 3: Component Features
