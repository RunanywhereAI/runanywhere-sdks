# CLAUDE.md

### Before starting work
- Always in plan mode to make a plan refer to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`.
- After get the plan, make sure you Write the plan to the appropriate file as mentioned in the guide that you referred to.
- If the task require external knowledge or certain package, also research to get latest knowledge (Use Task tool for research)
- Don't over plan it, always think MVP.
- Once you write the plan, firstly ask me to review it. Do not continue until I approve the plan.
### While implementing
- You should update the plan as you work - check `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md` if you're running an already created plan via `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`
- After you complete tasks in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes you made, so following tasks can be easily hand over to other engineers.
- Always make sure that you're using structured types, never use strings directly so that we can keep things consistent and scalable and not make mistakes.
- Read files FULLY to understand the FULL context. Only use tools when the file is large and you are short on context.
This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
- When fixing issues focus on SIMPLICITY, and following Clean SOLID principles, do not add complicated logic unless necessary!

## Swift specific rules:
- Use the latest Swift 6 APIs always.
- Do not use NSLock as it is outdated.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains cross-platform SDKs for the RunAnywhere on-device AI platform. The platform provides intelligent routing between on-device and cloud AI models to optimize for cost and privacy.

### SDK Implementations
- **Android SDK** (`sdk/runanywhere-android/`) - Kotlin-based SDK for Android
- **iOS SDK** (`sdk/runanywhere-swift/`) - Swift Package Manager-based SDK for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS

### Example Applications
- **Android Demo** (`examples/android/RunAnywhereAI/`) - Sample Android app demonstrating SDK usage
- **iOS Demo** (`examples/ios/RunAnywhereAI/`) - Sample iOS app demonstrating SDK usage

## Common Development Commands

### Android SDK Development

```bash
# Navigate to Android SDK
cd sdk/runanywhere-android/

# Build the SDK
./gradlew build

# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build release AAR
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### iOS SDK Development

```bash
# Navigate to iOS SDK
cd sdk/runanywhere-swift/

# Build the SDK
swift build

# Run tests
swift test

# Run tests with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage

# Run SwiftLint
swiftlint

# Build for specific platform
xcodebuild build -scheme RunAnywhere -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Android Example App

```bash
# Navigate to Android example
cd examples/android/RunAnywhereAI/

# Build the app
./gradlew build

# Run lint
./gradlew :app:lint

# Install on device/emulator
./gradlew installDebug

# Run tests
./gradlew test
```

### iOS Example App

To get logs for sample app and sdk use this in another terminal:
log stream --predicate 'subsystem CONTAINS "com.runanywhere"' --info --debug

For physical device:
idevicesyslog | grep "com.runanywhere"

#### Quick Build & Run (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to iOS example
cd examples/ios/RunAnywhereAI/
IMPORTANT!! - Always use build and run to run the project with correct device or sim
# Build and run on simulator (handles dependencies automatically)
./scripts/build_and_run.sh simulator "iPhone 16 Pro" --build-sdk

# Build and run on connected device
./scripts/build_and_run.sh device

# Clean build artifacts
./scripts/clean_build_and_run.sh
```

#### Manual Setup
```bash
# Install CocoaPods dependencies (required for TensorFlow Lite and ZIPFoundation)
pod install

# Fix Xcode 16 sandbox issues (required after pod install)
./fix_pods_sandbox.sh

# After pod install, always open the .xcworkspace file
open RunAnywhereAI.xcworkspace

# Run SwiftLint
./swiftlint.sh

# Verify model download URLs
./scripts/verify_urls.sh
```

#### Known Issues - Xcode 16 Sandbox

**Error**: `Sandbox: rsync deny(1) file-write-create`
**Fix**: After `pod install`, run `./fix_pods_sandbox.sh`
**Note**: Required after each `pod install`

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific checks
pre-commit run android-sdk-lint --all-files
pre-commit run ios-sdk-swiftlint --all-files
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core SDK Design Patterns

Both SDKs follow similar architectural patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Main SDK access through `RunAnywhereSDK.shared` (iOS) or `RunAnywhereSDK.getInstance()` (Android)
2. **Configuration-based Initialization**: Initialize with API key and optional settings
3. **Async/Promise-based APIs**: Modern async patterns (Kotlin coroutines for Android, async/await for iOS)
4. **Model Loading**: Universal model loader supporting multiple formats (GGUF, ONNX, Core ML, MLX, TFLite)
5. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic decision-making for on-device vs cloud execution
6. **Cost Tracking**: Real-time cost and savings tracking

### Key Components

**Android SDK Structure:**
- `RunAnywhereSDK.kt` - Main SDK entry point and singleton
- `Configuration.kt` - SDK configuration options
- `GenerationOptions.kt` - Text generation parameters
- `GenerationResult.kt` - Generation response with metrics
- `Message.kt` & `Context.kt` - Conversation management

**iOS SDK Structure:**
- `RunAnywhereSDK.swift` - Main SDK class with shared instance
- `Configuration.swift` - SDK configuration and policies
- `GenerationOptions.swift` - Generation parameters
- `GenerationResult.swift` - Results with cost tracking
- `Context.swift` & `Message.swift` - Conversation context

### Platform Requirements

**Android:**
- Minimum SDK: 24 (Android 7.0)
- Target SDK: 36
- Kotlin: 2.0.21
- Gradle: 8.11.1

**iOS:**
- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13.0+ / watchOS 6.0+
- Swift: 5.9+
- Xcode: 15.0+

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflows are configured for automated testing and building:

- **Path-based triggers**: Workflows only run when relevant files change
- **Platform-specific runners**: Ubuntu for Android, macOS for iOS
- **Artifact uploads**: Build outputs and test results are preserved
- **Lint enforcement**: Lint errors fail the build

Workflows are located in `.github/workflows/`:
- `android-sdk.yml` - Android SDK CI
- `ios-sdk.yml` - iOS SDK CI
- `android-app.yml` - Android example app CI
- `ios-app.yml` - iOS example app CI

## Development Notes

- Both SDKs are in early development with placeholder implementations
- The SDKs focus on privacy-first, on-device AI with intelligent routing
- Cost optimization is a key feature with real-time tracking
- Pre-commit hooks are configured for code quality enforcement
- SwiftLint is temporarily disabled in iOS SDK build due to plugin issues
