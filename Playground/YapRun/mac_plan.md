Now I have comprehensive details. Let me compile the complete UX walkthrough.

Here's the full Wispr Flow macOS user experience — end to end — so you can replicate it for RunAnywhere.
## Download & Install Experience
The entire install takes under 2 minutes: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

1. Go to **wisprflow.ai** → click **"Download for macOS"**
2. A `.dmg` file downloads (~100 MB) [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1nzi52c/wispr_flow_managed_to_get_their_shit_together/)
3. Open the DMG → **drag the Flow icon into Applications** [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
4. Launch Wispr Flow from Applications [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
5. **Sign in** (Apple Sign-In or email) [roadmap.wisprflow](https://roadmap.wisprflow.ai/changelog/pointup2-new-flow-bar-flow-pro)
6. Follow the on-screen setup prompts
## First-Launch Permissions
On first launch, macOS asks for two critical permissions: [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)

1. **Microphone** → `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone` — allow Wispr Flow
2. **Accessibility** → `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility` — allow Wispr Flow (needed for global hotkey capture, reading active app context, and simulating paste)

No other configuration is needed. The app is immediately ready to use. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
## What Appears On Screen
After setup, two things are visible:
### The Flow Bar (Floating Pill)
A small **rounded pill/bubble at the bottom center of the screen**. It: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

- Sits **always on top** of all windows, on every desktop/space
- Is semi-transparent and unobtrusive when idle
- **Left-click** it → starts hands-free dictation [roadmap.wisprflow](https://roadmap.wisprflow.ai/changelog/pointup2-new-flow-bar-flow-pro)
- **Right-click** it → shows quick settings (language, microphone selection) [roadmap.wisprflow](https://roadmap.wisprflow.ai/changelog/pointup2-new-flow-bar-flow-pro)
- Can be toggled off in Settings → "Show flow bar at all times" [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
### Menu Bar Icon
A small icon in the macOS menu bar (top-right area) for quick access to the Hub (main settings window). [willowvoice](https://willowvoice.com/blog/super-whisper-vs-wispr-flow-comparison-reviews-and-alternatives-in-2025)
## Core Dictation UX (Push-to-Talk)
This is the primary experience — **hold a key, speak, release, text appears**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

1. **Click into any text field** in any app (Slack, Gmail, Notes, Notion, Cursor, browser, etc.) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
2. **Hold the Fn key** (default hotkey) [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)
3. You hear an **audio ping** and see the Flow Bar animate with **white moving bars** (waveform) — this means the mic is live [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
4. **Speak naturally** — ramble, use filler words, change your mind mid-sentence [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
5. **Release the Fn key** [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)
6. Flow processes your speech (200ms start, 450ms paste in Instant Mode) [wisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/post/top-10-dictation-tools-december-2025)
7. **Formatted, clean text appears** exactly where your cursor was — filler words removed, punctuation added, paragraphs created as needed [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

If you just **tap** the hotkey instead of holding it, a reminder prompt appears telling you to hold it down. Press **Esc** while dictating to cancel — nothing pastes, but the transcript is saved in Recent Activity. [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)
## Hands-Free Dictation
For longer dictation without holding a key: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

1. Press **Fn + Space** → hands-free mode activates
2. An **X icon** and a **stop button (circle with square)** appear on the Flow Bar [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
3. The waveform animates to show the mic is active
4. **Speak freely** without holding any key
5. Press **Fn** once to stop and paste the transcript [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)
6. Or **click the stop button** on the Flow Bar [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
## Flow Bar Click Dictation
For people who prefer mouse over keyboard: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

1. **Click** the Flow Bar bubble → recording starts
2. Hover shows tooltip instructions
3. **Click again** → stops recording and pastes text
4. Same behavior as push-to-talk, just mouse-driven
## What the Text Looks Like
Flow doesn't just dump raw speech. Examples from the tutorial: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

| What you say | What Flow types |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Let's meet tomorrow. Actually, let's do Friday instead." | "Let's meet Friday." (one clean sentence) |
| "Grocery list, apples, pears, bananas, strawberries" | A bulleted list with colon header and one bullet per item |
| "um so like I was thinking maybe we could uh do that thing" | Clean sentence with filler removed |
| Mid-sentence corrections | Reshapes the sentence so it reads clean  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |

Flow also **adapts tone per app** — formal in Gmail, casual in iMessage, technical in Cursor. [wisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/post/wispr-flow-for-seamless-communication)
## The Hub (Main App Window)
Opened from the menu bar icon. Contains these sections: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
### Home
- **Today** — recent dictation history with full transcripts [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- **Stats** — total words dictated, words per minute (WPM) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- Quick tips (hands-free shortcut reminder)
### Dictionary
- Add custom words, names, jargon [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- **Misspelling correction**: e.g., you say "CJ" but want it typed as "C-J" with a dash — add the correction once, it's fixed forever [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- **Auto-add to Dictionary** option — Flow watches your corrections and learns automatically [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/images/160267873/a090ff18-8e94-4931-a7cb-616097500514/image.jpg)
- Up to 800 words/phrases [wisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/post/top-10-dictation-tools-december-2025)
- Shareable with your team [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
### Snippets
- Saved text shortcuts expanded by voice [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- Say a trigger phrase → Flow expands it to the full saved text
- Great for: email signatures, links, addresses, bios, boilerplate [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
### Styles
- Control how Flow writes and formats your words [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- Set different tones for different apps/tasks
- Keeps writing style consistent across tools
### Notes
- Built-in quick notes — press hotkey, speak a note, it's saved [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- Recent notes shown at bottom
- Notes sync across desktop and mobile [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/images/160267873/a090ff18-8e94-4931-a7cb-616097500514/image.jpg)
### Settings
Organized into tabs: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

| Tab | Options |
|-----|---------|
| **General** | Change push-to-talk hotkey, hands-free shortcut, command mode shortcut, paste-last-transcript shortcut. Reset to defaults button  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
| **System** | Launch at login (on/off), Show flow bar at all times, Show app in Dock, Dictation sound effects (audio ping), **Mute music while dictating** (ducks music, restores after)  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
| **Vibe** | Writing style/tone preferences  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
| **Coding** | Developer-specific settings  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
| **Experiment** | Auto-add to dictionary, smart formatting, email signature, creator mode  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
| **Account** | Login, plan management, reset app  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ) |
## Command Mode (Pro Feature)
For editing existing text with your voice: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

- Activate with a separate hotkey
- Speak instructions like: "make this more formal", "use lowercase in iMessage", "break into paragraphs" [wisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/post/wispr-flow-for-seamless-communication)
- Flow reads the surrounding text via the Accessibility API and applies the edit [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/images/160267873/a090ff18-8e94-4931-a7cb-616097500514/image.jpg)
## How It Stays Running
The app persistence model for your replication: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)

- **Agent app** — runs without a Dock icon by default (togglable) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- **Launch at login** — auto-starts with macOS [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlg3p5HdXRQ)
- **Global hotkey listener** — always monitoring for Fn press via `CGEvent` tap, even when the app has no window [docs.wisprflow](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6409258247-starting-your-first-dictation)
- **Near-zero CPU when idle** — only activates on hotkey press [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1nzi52c/wispr_flow_managed_to_get_their_shit_together/)
- **No background audio recording** — mic only activates when hotkey is held or hands-free is active [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1nzi52c/wispr_flow_managed_to_get_their_shit_together/)
- **Flow Bar** is an always-on-top overlay that shows the app is ready [roadmap.wisprflow](https://roadmap.wisprflow.ai/changelog/pointup2-new-flow-bar-flow-pro)
## Technical Implementation Summary for RunAnywhere macOS
| UX Element | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Flow Bar** | `NSPanel` with `.floating` level, `.borderless` style, `.canJoinAllSpaces` collection behavior |
| **Global Fn hotkey** | `CGEvent.tapCreate` with `kCGEventKeyDown`/`kCGEventKeyUp` for Fn key monitoring |
| **Audio ping on start** | `AVAudioPlayer` playing a short sound file on keyDown |
| **Waveform animation** | Core Animation or SwiftUI animation on the Flow Bar showing audio levels from `AVAudioEngine.inputNode.installTap` |
| **Text insertion** | Copy to `NSPasteboard.general`, then simulate `Cmd+V` via `CGEvent(keyboardEventSource:virtualKey:keyDown:)` |
| **Context awareness** | `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` on the focused element to read surrounding text |
| **App name detection** | `NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication?.localizedName` |
| **Mute music** | Use `MediaRemote` private framework or AppleScript to pause/play iTunes/Spotify |
| **Launch at login** | `SMAppService.mainApp.register()` (modern) or `SMLoginItemSetEnabled` (legacy) |
| **Agent mode (no Dock)** | `LSUIElement = YES` in Info.plist |
| **Menu bar** | `NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength:)` |
| **Settings/Hub** | Standard `NSWindow` shown on status item click |
| **Recent Activity** | Local SQLite or Core Data store of all transcriptions |
| **Dictionary/Snippets** | JSON or plist in App Group container, synced via CloudKit if needed |

The key difference for your build: instead of streaming audio to cloud, you run **Sherpa Whisper on-device** in the same process. On your M3 Max, Whisper Tiny should return results in <500ms, which is competitive with Wispr's cloud latency. [wisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/post/top-10-dictation-tools-december-2025)
